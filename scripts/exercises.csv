Make a GitHub account: https://github.com/  
Install GitHub Desktop on your computer: https://desktop.github.com/

Use GitHub Desktop to make a new repository called `prework-exercises`.  
Open the repository in your text editor, make a new file called `test.rb`  
Write some Ruby code:
```
puts 10
```
Use GitHub Desktop to commit your changes and publish your repository.

Open your GitHub repository in your web browser and add your instructor as a collaborator.",,

Write a brief introduction about yourself (a couple of sentences) describing your background and why you're interested in learning programming. Here's an example:
```My name is Babe Ruth. I've been playing professional baseball for the past 
number of years, but I'm finding that I've reached the top of the career 
ladder in my field. I'm looking to transition into a position in web development, 
because I find that it's a career in which I can truly express my creativity. 
I was always interested in coding, but was never able to get into it because 
computers haven't been invented yet. This is my chance to finally jump into it, 
and hopefully land a job at my dream company: MySpace.

    <h1>12 Days of Christmas Pie</h1>
    <img src=""http://christmasfoodrecipes.com/files/2013/11/Christmas-Pie.jpg"">
    <p>This sumptuous holiday delicacy is rarely served in today's ""on-the-go, on-demand"" society because of the difficulty of not only the procurement of the ingredients, but also because of the difficulty in preparing said ingredients. Traditionally served at Welsh mid-winter feasts, the <strong>12 Days of Christmas Pie</strong> will delight the senses and satiate the hunger of the most ardent <em>gourmand</em>. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <img src=""https://www.purelypoultry.com/images/embden-geese.jpg"">
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup partridge, feathers on</li>
      <li>2oz turtle dove</li>
      <li>3 french hens, quartered, berets included</li>
      <li>4 calling birds, preferably muted</li>
      <li>5lbs. golden onion rings</li>
      <li>6 geese, preferably a-laying eggs</li>
      <li>7 whole swans, feathers removed</li>

    <h2>Hearty Pie Filling</h2>
    <ol>Steps to preparing the heartiest of pie fillings:
      <li>Pre-heat the oven to 350F, and rub butter over the surfaces of the fowl.</li>
      <li>Combine the partridge, turtle dove, and onion rings in a food processor until combined.</li>
      <li>Place the mixture inside of the french hens.</li>
      <li>Stuff the french hens and calling birds into the geese. Expect the geese to protest. Rather vigorously, I should expect.</li>
      <li>Tie the swans and stuffed geeese together with twine, and place on a baking sheet. Place the sheet in the oven, on the bottom rack.</li>
     <li>Cook for 30min., then flip the bound fowl and cook for another 10min., or until tender.</li>
